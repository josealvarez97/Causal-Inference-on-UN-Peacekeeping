# Causal-Inference-on-UN-Peacekeeping

An assignment for my class in applied statistical inference (that I took during the fall of 2018). **Got very good grades for this one, so I'm uploading it here.**

## Some of the things that I was asked to do [here](https://github.com/josealvarez97/Causal-Inference-on-UN-Peacekeeping/blob/master/Causal_Inference-JoseAlvarez.pdf):

For this assignment, I used data from [Doyle & Sambanis (2000)](http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/cohen/codebook.pdf) to replicate figure 8 from [King & Zeng (2007)](http://j.mp/2owd1G1) - a figure about the marginal effect of UN'S efforts on War, but that intended _to highlight the degree of model dependence to which the conclusions of Doyle & Sambanis were affected by_. 

I also had to estimate the impact of the treatment (UN's peacekeeping operations) on the probability of achieving _lenient peacebuilding success_ 2 years, and 5 years, after war, where lenient peacebuilding success means that at least state sovereignty is not divided.
